# Churn_Predictor-Major_Project
Customer churn is the focal concern of most companies which are active in industries with low switching cost. Handling this issue, in this study, we developed a model building approach, which consists of classification phase. In the model building phasefew may algorithms were utilized in order to build the predictive model. Evaluating and comparing the performance of the employed algorithms based on “Gain measure”, we concluded that XGBoost algorithm produces more accuracy. Furthermore, dealing with our imbalanced dataset, we use SMOTE techniques for handling the class imbalance.
## overview
Online businesses typically treat a customer as churned once a particular amount of time has elapsed since the customer’s last interaction with the site or service. The full cost of churn includes both lost revenue and the marketing costs involved with replacing those customers with new ones. Reducing churn is a key business goal of every online business.
## objectives
1-The identification of the customers who are at the blink of churn and approximating the duration they will churn.
Focuses on analyzing the churn prediction techniques to identify the churn behavior and validate the reasons for customer churn
2-To reduce the risk of business
3-To understand the target market
4-To build a competitive advantage in the market
## scope 
1-To gain information for improvement
2-To reduce the risk of business
3-To understand the target market
4-To build a competitive advantage in the market
## limitations
*/A customer’s lifetime value and the growth of the business maintains a direct relationship between each other i.e., more chances that the customer would churn; the less is the potential for the business to grow. Even a good marketing strategy would not save a business if it continues to lose customers at regular intervals due to other reasons and spend more money on acquiring new customers who are not guaranteed to be loyal.
*/There is a lot of debate surrounding customer churn and acquiring new customers because the former is much more cost-effective and ensures business growth. Thus companies spend almost seven times more effort, and time to retain old customers than acquire a new one. The global value of a customer lost is nearly two hundred, and forty-three dollars which makes churning a costly affair for any business.
## outcome
The application provides the following:
